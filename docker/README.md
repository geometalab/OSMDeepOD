# Docker images

This project provides 4 docker images. Three images to train a convnet and one image to execute and distribute the recognition work.
The Dockerfiles are automated build by docker hub. You can pull it on the following links:
- [osm_crosswalk_detection - Recognition image](https://hub.docker.com/r/geometalab/osm-crosswalk-detection/ "")
- [keras_cuda - Training image](https://hub.docker.com/r/geometalab/keras_cuda/ "")
- [theano_cuda](https://hub.docker.com/r/geometalab/theano_cuda/ "")
- hualos_keras_cuda (obsolete)
